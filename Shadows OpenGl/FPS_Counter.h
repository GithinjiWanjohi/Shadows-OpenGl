/**
 * @brief Utility class that measures FPS.
 *
 * FPSCounter is a utility class that keeps track of FPS (frames per second) of
 *  your application. It can be a simple performance measurement tool.
 *
 * Using FPSCounter is simple: if you're using GLWidget then all you have to do
 *  is calling fps() or fpsString() method to find out the current FPS. You can
 *  also call timeElapsed() to find out how much time has elapsed since last
 *  frame was rendered. This could be useful e.g. in animations where an object
 *  has a fixed speed and you multiply it by the elapsed time every frame to
 *  find out how much the object should be moved.
 *
 * If you don't use GLWidget then you need to call nextFrame() every time that
 *  another frame is rendered.
 *
 * The fps value is recalculated once a second.
 *
 * You can also use totalTimeElapsed() to find out how much time has elapsed
 *  since nextFrame() was called the very first time.
 *
 * @see GLWidget
